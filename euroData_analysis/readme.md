# euroData-analysis
A probabilistic approach to describing the prevalance of voters unfavourable to the EU across the continent

The ‘Brexit’ phenomenon came as a rather unexpected event. However it was the direct result of a combination of demographic, 
psychological and political characteristics. The present analysis compared data derived from both UK citizens and other 
European countries by the Dalia Research Group (www.daliaresearch.com). The overarching purpose was to assess how citizens 
in other countries compare to that certain part of the UK population which voted for their country to leave the EU.
